###in the second step we need to make sure, our program can access our API and make news-requests, therefore we import the following. Keep in mind - we'll program the user input field later on.

##  MARKET DATA
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

#Setting the User Interface (GUI)
root = Tk()
root.geometry("1800x1800")

# def funktion for "show selection"
def var1():
    label1 = Label(root, text=selection.get())
    label1.grid(row=3, column=1)
    
def var3(): #same for "show second selection"
    label1 = Label(root, text=selection2.get())
    label1.grid(row=3, column=3)

# def function for plotting the sentiment analysis in a graph
def var2():
    # Input in the variable "phrase", the name of the stock chosen + adding the word stock to get every finance-related article
    phrase = str(selection) + " stock"

    # Adding my unique APIKey found by creating an account in the API 'newsapi-python"
    newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key='f704389a97e24101834d34232a5da98d')
    my_date = date.today() - timedelta(days=7)

    # Restricting the list to 10 articles to be more visible
    articles = newsapi.get_everything(q=phrase,
                                      from_param=my_date.isoformat(),
                                      language="en",
                                      sort_by="relevancy",
                                      page_size=10)

    # Printing all article summaries thanks to this loop, with their title + their publishing time + their ULR
    for article in articles['articles']:
        print(article['title'] + ' | ' + article['publishedAt'] + ' | ' + article['url'])
