# how to run the program

As previously discussed with Mario Silic, our program only works as a whole on the terminal. On other plattforms, such as pycharm or anaconda, the sentiment analysis does not work and only returns one value. So, for the program to run the terminal is needed.

With this said, the following will explain how to run it on terminal. First off, you must switch your terminal language to python. Next, all lines of “pip” have to be installed by the terminal. Otherwise, the program will not be able to connect with our libraries and API and therefore can’t make the wanted requests. For the sentiment analysis NLTK must be imported through the terminal, since it is the the Natural Language Toolkit used for the vader analysis. 
After all modules have been imported, the program can be run and will ask the user for the company he/she is searching for. This will be followed by the previously explained user interface and calculated charts. 
Lastly, it must be mentioned, that we only have one free month of analysis so if you want to test the program in January, the date of the code has to be changed.
